# VirusPopModel

This project was written to demonstrate the potential contribution of bacteriophage viruses carbon cycling within sea ice brines. Though within the cold, hypersaline interstitial waters of sea ice microbial activity is reduced compared to more temperate waters, physical concentration may enhance the contact rate between bacteria and their viruses to an extent which allows significant viral infection to take place. 

**We hypothesize that, as a result of this enhanced viral infection, viruses within sea ice brines may play an out-sized role in facilitating carbon cycling by contributing dissolved organic carbon to sea ice brine DOC pools in the form of lytic material.

Here, we have built a simple population dynamic model using ordinary differential equations to demonstrate potential and constrain rates of viral infection and virally-mediated carbon cycling within sea ice brines. First, we use values collected from literature to show that without physical concentration due to brine concentrating factor viral infection would have negligble impact on microbial populations and carbon cycling within sea ice. The parameters are given in the Spreadsheet titled XXX.xlsx

Secondly, we apply a physical concentration parameter to the model. This physical concentration, a result of tightly constricted pore space within sea ice crystals, has been suggested to increase the relative contact rate (RCR) of viruses and bacteria within sea ice brines compared to underlying seawater. The relationship between RCR and temperature, calculated by Wells and Deming 2006b, is shown in WellsRCR.png
